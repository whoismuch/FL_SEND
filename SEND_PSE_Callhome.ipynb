    "This notebook demonstrates data preparation, feature extraction, model definition, and training for the FL-SEND (Federated Speaker Embedding-aware Neural Diarization) project. It includes steps to:\n",
    "- Load the AMI dataset via Hugging Face.\n",
    "- Group data by meeting ID to simulate realistic overlapping speech.\n",
    "- Apply power-set encoding to represent overlapping speaker labels.\n",
    "- Simulate overlapping speech segments.\n",
    "- Extract log-Mel spectrogram features.\n",
    "- Build the SEND model architecture.\n",
    "- Create PyTorch datasets and dataloaders.\n",
